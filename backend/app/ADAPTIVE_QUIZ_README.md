```python
# Submit user response
response = {"answer": "retirement"}

result = await adaptive_service.submit_response_and_get_next(
    session_data, 
    response
)

# Check if quiz is complete
if result.get('completed'):
    insights = result['insights']
    matches = result['matches']
    recommendations = result['recommendations']
else:
    next_question = result['question']
    progress = result['progress']
```

```

### Test Output Example
```
============================================================
TESTING ADAPTIVE QUIZ SYSTEM
============================================================

1. Starting adaptive quiz...
‚úì Quiz started successfully
  Session ID: 377d9291-21ed-41ad-a23a-83e708185bb6
  First question: When do you expect to need the money you are investing?
  Question type: multiple_choice
  Progress: 12.5%

2. Processing 8 test responses...
   Response 1: {'answer': 'retirement'}
   ‚úì Response processed. Next question: How comfortable are you with...
   Progress: 25.0%
   
   [... continues until completion ...]
   
3. Final Results:
   Total insights generated: 6
   Broker matches found: 5

```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for AI functionality
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# Optional: AI model configuration
LLM_MODEL_NAME=gemini-1.5-flash-latest
MAX_QUESTIONS_PER_REQUEST=12
```

### Customization Options

#### Focus Areas
```python
# Default focus areas
focus_areas = [
    "investment_goals",
    "risk_assessment", 
    "broker_preferences",
    "service_needs"
]

# Dynamic focus areas added based on responses
dynamic_areas = [
    "retirement_planning",
    "tax_optimization", 
    "estate_planning"
]
```

#### Question Topics
```python
# Core topics (always covered)
core_topics = [
    ("Investment goals and timeline", "FINANCIAL_GOALS"),
    ("Risk tolerance and comfort level", "RISK_TOLERANCE"),
    ("Investment experience and knowledge", "EXPERIENCE"),
    ("Service preferences and communication style", "PREFERENCES")
]

# Advanced topics (context-dependent)
advanced_topics = [
    ("Specific investment sectors of interest", "PREFERENCES"),
    ("Tax planning considerations", "FINANCIAL_GOALS"),
    ("Estate planning needs", "FINANCIAL_GOALS"),
    ("International investment exposure", "PREFERENCES"),
    ("Alternative investment interest", "EXPERIENCE"),
    ("Retirement planning specifics", "FINANCIAL_GOALS")
]
```

## üîç How It Works

### 1. **Session Initialization**
- Creates unique session ID
- Determines initial focus areas based on user profile
- Generates first question using AI

### 2. **Adaptive Question Flow**
```
User Response ‚Üí Response Analysis ‚Üí Focus Area Update ‚Üí 
Topic Selection ‚Üí Question Type Selection ‚Üí AI Generation ‚Üí 
Fallback Check ‚Üí Question Delivery
```

### 3. **Completion Logic**
- **Minimum**: 5 questions answered
- **Maximum**: 12 questions total
- **Smart completion**: 4+ focus areas + 3+ insights
- **Reason tracking**: Why quiz completed

### 4. **Insights Generation**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### AI Generation Fails
```python
# Fallback questions are automatically used
# Check GEMINI_API_KEY configuration
# Verify internet connectivity
```

#### Session Data Lost
```python
# Implement Redis session storage
# Add session recovery mechanisms
# Use database backup for critical sessions
```

#### Slow Response Times
```python
# Check AI API rate limits
# Implement question caching
# Optimize database queries
```

### Debug Mode
```python
# Enable detailed logging
import logging
logging.getLogger('app.services.adaptive_quiz_service').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```
