# Password Security Guide

This guide explains how password security is implemented in our broker matching platform and provides examples of how to use it in your application.

## Overview

Our platform uses industry-standard password security practices:

1. **Password Hashing**: We use bcrypt for password hashing, which is a strong adaptive hashing function designed specifically for passwords.
2. **Salt Generation**: bcrypt automatically generates a unique salt for each password hash, protecting against rainbow table attacks.
3. **Configurable Work Factor**: The bcrypt algorithm uses a work factor (cost) parameter that can be increased over time as hardware improves.
4. **No Plain-text Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text, only as irreversible hashes.

## How It Works

### Password Hashing Flow

1. User registers with a plain text password
2. Application hashes the password using bcrypt
3. The hash is stored in the database
4. When the user attempts to log in, their entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash

### Code Implementation

Our security module (`app/core/security.py`) provides these key functions:

```python
# Hash a password (used during registration or password change)
hashed_password = get_password_hash(plain_password)

# Verify a password (used during login)
is_password_correct = verify_password(plain_password, stored_hash)
```

### What a Bcrypt Hash Looks Like

A bcrypt hash contains several components:

```
$2b$12$CFmqAQcHwL6u0RTV7dq7xu7w4JagQvz8d8ySUQow7/O.jY8VPnhuO
│ │  │                     └── Hash
│ │  └── Cost factor (work factor)
│ └── Bcrypt algorithm version
└── Hash algorithm identifier
```

- `$2b$` indicates the bcrypt algorithm and version
- `12` is the cost factor (work factor)
- The remainder is the salt and the hash combined

## Testing & Verification

To verify the password hashing is working, use our utility scripts:

1. Simple password hash test: `python -m utils.password_test`
2. User-based password test: `python -m utils.test_user_simple`

### Example Output

```
Created user with email: test@example.com
Password hash: $2b$12$CFmqAQcHwL6u0RTV7dq7xu7w4JagQvz8d8ySUQow7/O.jY8VPnhuO

Verifying correct password: SecurePassword123!
Result: ✅ Success

Verifying incorrect password: WrongPassword456!
Result: ✅ Success
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Protection Against Data Breaches**: If your database is compromised, attackers only get hashed passwords, not plain text.
2. **Protection Against Rainbow Tables**: The unique salt for each password makes pre-computed tables ineffective.
3. **Protection Against Brute Force**: bcrypt is intentionally designed to be slow, making brute force attacks impractical.
4. **Future-proofing**: The work factor can be increased as computing power improves.

## Integration with User Authentication

In the user service (`app/services/user_service.py`), we implement:

```python
def authenticate_user(db: Session, email: str, password: str) -> Optional[User]:
    """Authenticate a user by email and password"""
    user = get_user_by_email(db, email)
    if not user:
        return None
    if not verify_password(password, user.password_hash):
        return None
    return user
```

## Password Policy Recommendations

1. **Minimum Length**: At least 8 characters
2. **Complexity**: Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
3. **No Common Passwords**: Reject commonly used passwords
4. **No Personal Information**: Avoid using names, dates, or other personal info
5. **Regular Updates**: Prompt for changes every 60-90 days for sensitive applications

## Implementation in API Endpoints

Our auth endpoints in `app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py` handle:

1. User registration with password hashing
2. User login with password verification
3. Password reset functionality
4. JWT token generation upon successful authentication

## Testing Authentication

You can test the full authentication flow with our utility script:

```
python -m utils.test_login --email user@example.com --password SecurePassword123!
```

## Best Practices for Production

1. **HTTPS Only**: Always transmit passwords over HTTPS
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for login attempts
3. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Consider adding 2FA for sensitive operations
4. **Account Lockout**: Implement temporary account lockouts after failed attempts
5. **Secure Password Recovery**: Use secure token-based password recovery
